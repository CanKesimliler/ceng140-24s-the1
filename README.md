Take home exam 1 for the CENG140 course
There are some limitations that prevent me from using libraries and pointer usage.
Also I have to use ANSI C so I did not have the access to some modern features like dynamic arrays.
All things considered I think memory side has a room for improvement with a better map and dynamic arrays but I think,
it is pretty fast and has complexity of O(N^2) which may even be further reduced by implementing a kmp like algorithm to at the findExon2 function.

# Setbacks:
1- Erroneous inputs are not taken into the consideration.
2- Intron Exon format is set.
3- Some edge cases might go under the radar and needs to be further investigated.
